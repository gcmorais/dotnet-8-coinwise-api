## <a name="apresentation">Introduction</a>

Fictional application made to study clean architecture, CQRS and testing.

See for yourself by running it on your machine by following the steps below.

## <a name="basicUsage">Basic Usage</a>

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

**Prerequisites**
<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [.NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [SQL Server Express](https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)
- [SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)

**Cloning the Repository**
<a name="cloning"></a>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gcmorais/dotnet-8-coinwise-api.git
cd dotnet-8-coinwise-api
```

**Installation**
<a name="installation"></a>

Open the solution in Visual Studio to automatically install the project dependencies.

```bash
coinwise.sln
```

> [!note]
>
>  Run the `dotnet restore` command, the .NET CLI uses NuGet to look for these dependencies and download them if necessary. 


**Connect to the database**
<a name="connectdb"></a>

We first need to connect to the database, so in the <strong>appsettings.json</strong> file in `DefaultConnection` in the server tag you will put the name of your server that was created in SQL Server Express;

```env
"DefaultConnection": "server= localhost\\Example; database= ExampleDB; trusted_connection=true; trustservercertificate=true"
```

I used the database connection via Windows authentication, so use the tag `trusted_connection = true;` 

if you need it, use the tags `user id=login;` `password=password;` see if it makes sense in your use case.

**Running the Project**
<a name="running"></a>

First, let's run the migrations to create the tables for our database.
To do this, we'll open the Package Manager Console and issue the command:

```bash
add-migration FirstMigration
```

After the Build successful message is returned from the console, use the following command to actually create the modifications within the database:

```bash
update-database
```


Run your project (CRTL + F5 in visual studio) to open [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) in your browser to view the project.
